```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Using the 'hide-input' tag to hide code when necessary. This will make notebooks easier to follow for readers.

- The resources under **Helpful Links** are a good starting point for guidance, and doing my own search, I can see that there are even more resources available outside of the official documentation.

- Having all of the required packages set up in a Conda environment is important to ensure that building the Jupyter Notebook runs smoothly.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- I struggled with relative URLs and making sure that the markdown files pointed to the right folders. I initially wanted to organize the files within a folder, but I would get errors if the files were in subfolders. I would like to explore the reason behind this more.

- The importance of indentation in the _toc.yml file. Particularly, not realizing the sensitivity of using 'tab' instead of two spaces when breaking down by 'parts'.
